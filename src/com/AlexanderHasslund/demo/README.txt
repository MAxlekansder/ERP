This project is to learn more about dynamic and OOP structures in java.
This project will be written with Spring boot and have a SQL-connection when everything is at its place.
With trying to build a smaller downscaled ERP-system based in Java, alongside with an user interface hopefully built in
javascript, the purpose is to learn as much as possible along the way.

This project is not going to be rushed and will prob never be finished.
